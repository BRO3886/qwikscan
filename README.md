## The Idea

The idea for this app was very simple. We go to supermarkets and nearby grocery stores even during this pandemic because getting suppies for home is absolutely essential.

A problem we found with the system here in India is that even though people sometimes follow social distancing, but in long queues, lack of pateince gets the best of us. Thus, we rarely see people following social distancing on cash counters.

So we came up with this app (..or you could say 2 apps). 

This is QwickScan Client side.

## Features

- [x]  Login/Sign Up
- [x]  Splash Screen (Hack Requirement)
